        <div>
				<ul>
				<li><strong><span class="auto-style1"><em>Personal Background:</em></span></strong> Hello my name is Felix 
				Viruet sounds like (Ver-ret). I am 34 yrs. old, originally from 
				NYC now living in Charlotte NC, I have a nice big family which includes 
				my wonderful wife which I have been married to for 13 years and 
				our 7 daughters. I served in the U.S. Army for 12 1/2 years, deployed 
				4 times all to Afghanistan. After my Army career, I worked as an 
				Operation Manager for a year in a small car company that was part 
				of Griffin Automotive Company located in Monroe NC. Now I am a full-time 
				student here at CPCC working on my Associates Degree in Information 
				Technologies &Aacute; Business Marketing. </li>
				<li><strong><em><span class="auto-style1">Academic Background:</span></em></strong> Most of my academic background 
				is all military related. I have completed some college courses on 
				my way to completing my degrees here at CPCC. </li>
				<li><strong><em><span class="auto-style1">Professional Background:</span></em></strong> Like I mentioned above 
				I am an Army Veteran, my background is in the logistics field. Before 
				I was medically discharged in 2015 I finished my career as a Drill 
				Sergeant/Instructor which was very tiring but fun and important 
				to me since I was able to help change people lives if they were 
				able to complete basic training. </li>
				<li><strong><em><span class="auto-style1">Primary Computer Platform:</span></em></strong> Lenovo with Windows 
				10 </li>
				<li><strong><em><span class="auto-style1">Courses I'm taking, and why:</span></em></strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>WEB115:</strong> Required for my degree</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong><em><span class="auto-style1">Funny Story to remember me by:</span></em></strong> I already told 
				you that I have a big family well one day we went shopping at Ikea 
				and I left all of them upstairs in the cafeteria while I ran back 
				to the car to get my wallet. When I returned they were all sitting 
				down eating and when I asked them did you pay they said no someone 
				else had paid for the entire meal. That was very thoughtful of that 
				couple.</li>
